## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add/Remove products from the cart
- Edit product quantities in the cart
- Fill in all fields in the checkout
- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
  - Shipping always adds $50 to the order
  - VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
- **Bonus**: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

## My process

### Built with

- JSX
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For Routes
- [Formik](https://formik.org) - For Form
- [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) - For Form Validation
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- I decided to use Tailwind since i wanted to learn Tailwind.. Tailwind is pretty cool! I was really against using Tailwind. Mostly because of how it makes HTML look 'messy'. While that still remains the case I was pleasantly surprised by how intuitive it became. Also the ease with which you can build components was welcomed.
- I also learnt how to use Formik and Yup for form validations.. i was amazed on how super easy and stress free it was to set up form validations with formik and yup and also with less code.

- if your are using react router, By default if you have a long content page and then you navigate to another long content page, you will stay scrolled down. This behavior doesnâ€™t make lots of sense because not many people like to read text upside down. i had to google how to scroll to the top when a user navigate to another page so i found this solution:

- Create a wrapper component that handles scroll restoration for you:

```jsx
// ScrollToTop.jsx
// ScrollToTop Wrapper
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { useLocation } from "react-router";

const ScrollToTop = (props) => {
  const location = useLocation();
  useEffect(() => {
    window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  }, [location]);

  return <>{props.children}</>;
};
```

- Wrap the ScrollToTop Wrapper component round your application

```jsx
// App.jsx

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from "react-router-dom";

import LandingPage from "./LandingPage";
import ProductPage from "./ProductPage";
import ScrollToTop from "./ScrollToTop";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <ScrollToTop>
        <Switch>
          <Route path="/" exact>
            <LandingPage />
          </Route>

          <Route path="/product">
            <ProductPage />
          </Route>
        </Switch>
      </ScrollToTop>
    </Router>
  );
};
```
